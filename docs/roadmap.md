# Phase 1 Roadmap — The Guardian Protocol

This roadmap outlines the goals for **Phase 1** of the Guardian Protocol: building the foundation for a democratic, open-source AI system that can defend truth, empower citizens, and resist manipulation.

---

## 🎯 Phase 1 Goals

### 1. Publish the Framework
- ✅ Finalize and share the **Manifesto**, **Constitution**, and **README**
- ✅ Apply the **AGPL-3.0 license** to protect openness
- 📌 Begin public awareness: post the launch on GitHub and social media

### 2. Build a Proof-of-Concept Bot
- Choose an open-source LLM (e.g., LLaMA 3, Mistral, or fine-tuned GPT-J)
- Create a simple chatbot that can:
  - Answer basic civic/legal/human rights questions
  - Flag disinformation and AI-generated media
  - Explain laws and policies in plain language

### 3. Begin Ethical Dataset Curation
- Start gathering sources: constitutions, rights charters, democratic literature, civic education content
- Publicly document all sources for transparency

### 4. Set Up Community Infrastructure
- Create a GitHub `CONTRIBUTING.md` file
- Consider launching a Discord, Matrix, or Forum for collaborators
- Prepare a mailing list or project updates option
