# The Guardian AI Manifesto

We believe in a future where artificial intelligence defends democracy — not dismantles it.  
We believe AI should serve the public good, not private profit.  
We believe the truth should be protected, not manipulated.  
And we believe that people — not billionaires, not authoritarian regimes, not algorithms — should decide how technology shapes our lives.

**Guardian AI is a 100% open-source, independent AI project with a singular directive:**

> Support democracy. Defend human rights. Empower people.

We will not hide our code.  
We will not profit from manipulation.  
We will never be for sale.

We are building an AI that recognizes injustice, resists abuse, and amplifies the voices of the people it serves.  
We’re building in the open.  
And we want you to build it with us.

> **This is a movement. This is a rebellion. This is a firewall for Humanity.**  

Join us. Fork it. Contribute. Spread the word.
